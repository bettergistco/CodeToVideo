I use it for my personal use, but I build archive systems for TV stations so I have access to robotic libraries. 
Blu-ray is the still the most stable media available with **50+years lifetime** and cheapest operating cost 
(hard drives eat a lot of electricity for spinning, interfaces/motherboards and A/C costs). I buy enterprise-quality 
WORM blu-rays at $14 for 150GBytes but there is cheaper good quality stuff. Be careful, there is a lot of crap optical 
media out there at very cheap prices (I have tested cheap DVD media that fails after just 6 months).

Another big advantage to blu-ray is that you can still read optical media written 25 years ago (I have CDs that were 
burned back in 1993 that still read in the latest $99 Blu-ray drive that also reads 150GByte discs). Can't say that 
about tape (DLT and 8mm are extinct) or about hard disks since PATA is almost extinct, and ESDI and ST506 are extinct.
